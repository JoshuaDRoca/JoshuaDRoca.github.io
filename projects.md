### Welcome to the Projects Page!
Below are a few assignments and projects that I've worked on while in college.

## DegreeWorks Scraper
Here is one of my favortite projects that I have been apart of! This was an entirely individual project for my Internship class in Spring 2024. The goal of this project was to create a web app that allows faculty of Clayton State University to quickly download an Excel file containing details about any student's class history! This also works for students wanting to download a file for themselves. All you have to do is log into the CSU Login page that is opened in a new, automated Chrome browser, and let the app do the rest! Here is a link to the [Github repo](https://github.com/JoshuaDRoca/ScraperApp)!

## Launchpad Research Project
This is an exciting project that I am participating in as part of the Launchpad Leadership Academy program here at Clayton State University. Our research team is exploring the topic of conversational sentiment analysis (CSA) using modern machine learning techniques. This area of research is surprisingly burgeoning and being worked on by professionals in the industry, so our research has been focused on covering the latest achievements. On top of simply stating research facts, our team has also constructed an application that showcases some of the progress made within CSA in the form of a chatbox application. [Linked here is our research paper.](https://github.com/JoshuaDRoca/JoshuaDRoca.github.io/files/14603702/Sentiment_Analysis_Research_Paper.pdf)[Sentiment_Analysis_Research_Paper.pdf]
 And below is a video showcasing our chatbox app.

## Python Recursive Descent Parsing
Second is a project that I worked on in my Programming Languages class! This small program simulates a standard parser which would be used to tokenize regular expressions into correctly-understood character for our machine to interpret. This was also my first assignment using Python after learning most of my Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts with Java. I'm happy to say the switch to Python was easy to make, and I am not confident to use Python in most circumstances. Below is a video showcasing the program briefly.

## Logisim Digital Clock
Third is a slightly different type of assignment which was done in my Computer Organization and Architechture where I digitally wired a working digital clock! Working on this project was so much fun, I learned so many things about gray code, k-mapping, and boolean algebra work. I had no clue this type of math was done within circuitry work, and once this assignment was finally finished, and I had a fresh appreciation for those who do this type of work daily. Below is a short video displaying the Logisim clock.

## Java Chat Box
The fourth project is yet another chat box, except I worked on this entirely alone. This assingment was done in order to practice file management and the input/output dynamic. This is indeed one of my favorite projects simply because of my experience figuring out how to making it work. Recursively reading data from a file and formatting correctly was the easy part, but appending writing to that question while maintaining formatting was not as simple. Thankfully, I have a quick video to showcase a working result!

## Java EBook Reader
The fifth project is a small eBook reader class system that simulates an eBook reader's menu and functionality. This is an early programming assignment which covers very basic principles of OOP, however I still wanted to showcase it here. The program meshes together many foundational concepts within programming all working together properly to create a smooth user experience, which makes it important to share here on my portfolio! Again, below is a brief video showcasing the code.
