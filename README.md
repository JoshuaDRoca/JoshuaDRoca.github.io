_Hey There!_ My name is Josh Roca, and this is my portfolio!

Below is brief description of who I am and what I'm passionate about!

But before that... [Here's a link to my Project page](./projects.html). [And here's a link to my LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/josh-roca/)!

### A little about me.

Currently I am a senior at Clayton State University (CSU), and my major is Computer Science! I plan on graduating in May 2024, so I'm currently looking for associate level postions in software development. My focus is to be part of a Product Development or Quality Assurance team, both of those fields really interest me! 

I have most of my experience using Java, Python, and JavaScript; I have also used the React framework, and I'm hoping to learn more by using it more often! Here are a few tables that show my skills and knowledge:

###### Technical Skills

| * Java   | * Playwright |
| * Python | * HTML/CSS   |
| * SQL    | * JavaScript | 

###### Relevant Courses

| * Data Structures and Algorithms     | * OS Security and Administration         |
| * Computer Networks and Security     | * Parallel and Distributed Computing     |

### My Experience

###### Launchpad Leadership Academy

At Launchpad I was able to interact with Intuit Mailchimp employees from across the company in a workshop styled co-op environment. We covered a wide variety of topics such as infrastructure operations, front-end engineering, quality assurance, security, data analytics and machine learning, and so much more. The Launchpad Leadershpi Academy program is offered by Clayton State University, and it truly was an amazing way for me to expose myself to the Computer Science job market and learn which field I'm most interested in. As part of the program, I was in a research group project where we created a chat box application which uses machine learning for sentiment analysis. Check out more about the project on my [Projects Page](./projects.html)!

###### Clayton State Peer Tutor

Also, from October 2022 to the present, I have been a work-study student working as a peer tutor. I've found that being a tutor allows me to sharpen my understanding of past classes by assisting others, which, in turn, helps me to grasp the content I'm currently learning more fully. I also believe that being a tutor has opened up my communication skills, specifically being able to accurately and confidently explain difficult concepts whether in Computer Science or Mathematics. Upon graduating and joining a team of developers in the work-force, I'm confident I will be able to communicate effectively in ways that will make the best use of precious time during a sprint. 

###### Extracurricular Activites

During my time in college, I've been able to use my spare time for some extracurriculars that have helped me in many ways! For one, I was able to serve as the Community Service Chair for CSU's National Society of Leadership and Success (NSLS) branch. In that role I oversaw the many projects that the club was doing around the community, my favorite being the annual "Safe Halloween" that takes place in Morrow, Ga! At the Safe Halloween, CSU's NSLS branch is priveledged to give out candy and serve the local kids of Morrow for an evening.

On top of everything, I was able to start a Bible study club on campus! Truth Talk Bible Studies were born out of a desire to see Jesus' name be shared and talked about at Clayton State, and I'm proud to be a part of such a initiative. Overseeing Truth Talk has consisted of planning and organizing weekly Bible studies, monthly worship nights, and facilitating outreach at CSU's orientation events.
